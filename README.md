# 📁 End-to-End Corporate DevOps Pipeline Implementation

## 🔧 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a full-scale **DevOps pipeline** implementation designed for a corporate production-like environment. It includes infrastructure provisioning, CI/CD automation, Kubernetes deployment, and monitoring — all built from scratch to simulate a real-world DevOps workflow.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ Automated Infrastructure Provisioning
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline using **Jenkins**
- ✅ Static code analysis with **SonarQube**
- ✅ Artifact management with **Nexus Repository**
- ✅ Container orchestration using **Kubernetes (K8s)**
- ✅ Git integration for version control and pipeline triggers
- ✅ Scalable and secure architecture

## 🛠️ Setup & Implementation

### 1. Infrastructure Provisioning

- Provisioned Virtual Machines (on-prem or cloud) for:
  - Jenkins
  - SonarQube
  - Nexus Repository
- Installed Docker and Kubernetes on VMs.
- Set up a Kubernetes cluster using `kubeadm` or a cloud-managed solution.

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins)

- Integrated GitHub repository with Jenkins via webhooks.
- Jenkins Pipeline:
  - Pull source code from Git
  - Perform code quality checks via SonarQube
  - Build and package application (e.g., with Maven or Gradle)
  - Push artifacts to Nexus Repository
  - Deploy Docker images to Kubernetes

### 3. Kubernetes Deployment

- Created Kubernetes YAML files for:
  - Deployments
  - Services
  - ConfigMaps and Secrets (if needed)
- Used `kubectl` to deploy applications into the cluster.

### 4. Monitoring & Logging (Optional)

- Tools like Prometheus & Grafana can be added for observability.

## 📈 Outcomes

- Automated builds and deployments across environments
- Improved code quality with static analysis
- Centralized artifact repository
- Scalable Kubernetes-based deployment

---

## 📎 Notes

- This project simulates a real-world DevOps pipeline suitable for enterprise-level applications.
- Components are modular and can be swapped based on organization preferences (e.g., GitLab CI, ArgoCD, etc.).
